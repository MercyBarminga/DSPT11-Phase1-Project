**Project Overview**

![Business Overview](images/Business.png)


This project explores and analyzes aviation accident data to uncover commmon trends and patterns. This is to provide insights that can support business decisions, such as acquiring a new fleet, improving safety measures, and understanding accident dynamics.

Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for initial data analysis, and Tableau for dashboard creation, I highlight the critical factors influencing aviation accidents over time.
**Key Analysis Areas**


![Key Analysis Areas](images/trend-analytics.png)

**Accidents by Year**

![Accidents by Year]("images/Bar Graph of year versus number of accidents.png"): Visualized trends in the number of aviation accidents over the years.

**Fatal Injuries**

Fatal Injuries: Identified the year with the most and least fatal injuries.

**Make and Model Analysis**

![Make and Model Analysis]("images/Aircraft make versus number of accidents.png"): Highlighted the most common aircraft makes and models involved in accidents.

Weather Conditions: Determined the most prevalent weather conditions during accidents.

Broad Phase of Flight: Analyzed at what phase (e.g., landing, takeoff) most accidents occurred.

Top Indicators: Extracted total accidents, total fatal injuries, and most common flight/weather conditions.

Technologies Used
Python: Data cleaning and preliminary analysis (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding environment

Git & GitHub: Version control and project management

Tableau: Interactive dashboards and data visualization

 **Recommendations**
 
Prioritize aircraft models with fewer historical accident records when acquiring new fleets.

Pay special attention to weather patterns; VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions) dominated accident weather conditions.

Focus on pilot training during the landing phase, which had high accident counts.

Invest in preventive maintenance and operational safety for the most common makes/models identified.

Accident patterns from previous years suggest consistent monitoring and updating of aviation safety protocols.
